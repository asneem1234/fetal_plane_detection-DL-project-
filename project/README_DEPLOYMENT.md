# üöÄ DEPLOYMENT - QUICK START

## TL;DR - Fastest Way to Deploy

### **Option 1: Railway (EASIEST - All-in-One)**

```bash
# 1. Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# 2. Run the deployment script
cd project
.\deploy.ps1   # Windows
# OR
./deploy.sh    # Mac/Linux

# 3. Choose option 1 (Railway)
# 4. Add environment variables in Railway dashboard:
#    - GOOGLE_API_KEY = your-google-api-key
#    - NODE_ENV = production
```

**‚úÖ Done! Your app is live at: `https://your-project.up.railway.app`**

---

### **Option 2: Vercel (Frontend Only)**

You need TWO deployments:

**A. Deploy ChromaDB First:**
```bash
# Option A1: Railway for ChromaDB
railway init
railway up

# Option A2: Or use ChromaDB Cloud
# Sign up at: https://www.trychroma.com/
```

**B. Deploy Your App:**
```bash
npm install -g vercel
cd project
vercel

# Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
# - GOOGLE_API_KEY
# - CHROMA_URL (your ChromaDB URL)
# - NODE_ENV=production

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```
